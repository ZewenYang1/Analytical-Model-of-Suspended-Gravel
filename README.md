Yang et al. 2025-Saturated, smashed and suppressed: the fate of suspended gravel in large palaeofloods.

This MATLAB model accompanies the paper "Saturated, smashed and suppressed: the fate of suspended gravel in large palaeofloods." by Yang Zewen, Carling Paul, Liu Weiming, Wang Hao, Yang Anna, Zhou Gordon G. D. The model was written in MATLAB version R2017a.
The model was used to analyse suspended gravel deposition and thick horizontal deposits formation in palaeofloods.

The model consists of the following scripts:
- Model1_HydraulicVariable.m
- Model2_SbDivideCbConcentrationProfile.m
- Model3_StProfileDistributionAndRootMeanSquareVelocity.m
- Model4_StAndTimeWITHyDivideh.m
- Model5_TKEwithBeta.m
- Model6_RWithDifferentDepthWithTime.m
- Model7_GDivideR2WithTime.m
- Model8_C_starWithGR2.m
